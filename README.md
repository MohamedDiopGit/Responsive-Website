# Site-with-JS-menu
 First reactive website with the use of CSS - HTML - JS, it has a menu with toggling.
 
 Update :   - Restriction access for directories with .htacces/.htpasswd files
            - Use of PHP and server for SQL request
            - Twitter API on it

Take a look at the responsiveness by resizing the page and displaying the menu for example.
You have some funny motion of icon when you put your mouse on it.
